This Python script is a GIF Creator with a user-friendly graphical interface built using Tkinter. It allows users to create GIFs from sequentially named images in a selected folder. The program features:

    Folder Selection:
        A "Browse" button enables users to select a folder containing the images.

    Frame Rate Customization:
        Users can specify the desired frames per second (FPS), controlling the speed of the resulting GIF.

    Image Handling:
        Images are sorted numerically by filename (from 1 to any higher number), resized to match the dimensions of the first image, and combined into a GIF.

    Error Handling:
        The program displays error messages for invalid inputs, such as empty folders, missing images, or non-positive FPS values.

    Output:
        The GIF is saved as output.gif in the same folder as the images, with a success notification shown upon completion.

This tool is ideal for quickly creating GIFs from image sequences while offering flexibility in frame rate and ensuring uniform image sizes.
